1. Install Python 3 on your system if it is not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install OpenCV for Python using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip3 install opencv-python`
3. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Francesco-cpu/CameraGrabber.git`
4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository using the following command:
`cd CameraGrabber`

## Usage

You can run the script from the command line using the following command:
`python3 cameraGrabber.py -c <camera_index>`


Replace `<camera_index>` with the name of the camera you want to use (usually /dev/video0 for the default camera).
