# Camera Grabber

This Python script captures video from a camera using the OpenCV library and displays it in a window. The user can quit the program by pressing the 'q' key.

## Usage

To use this script, you must have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. You can run the script from the command line using the following command:
python cameraGrabber.py -c `<camera_index>`


Replace `<camera_index>` with the name of the camera you want to use (usually /dev/video0 for the default camera).
